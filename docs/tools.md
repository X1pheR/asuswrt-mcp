# Tool reference

`asuswrt-mcp` exposes **67 explicit MCP tools**: **55 read-only tools** and **12 management tools**. The server deliberately has no arbitrary SSH, arbitrary NVRAM, firmware flash/reset, bootloader, generic command or generic HTTP escape hatch.

## Management safety contract

Router mutations are disabled unless `ASUSWRT_ALLOW_MUTATIONS=true`. A real management change additionally requires `confirm=true`; `dry_run=true` returns the planned operation without changing router state. Mixed tools with a `list` action keep that action read-only. Inputs are validated and operations remain bounded to the allowlisted router behavior implemented by the tool.

Sensitive router material is minimized or redacted. In particular, tools do not expose Wi-Fi PSKs, VPN keys/peer identities/endpoints, DNS resolver values where only posture/counts are needed, or raw client-policy/rule payloads where a sanitized summary is sufficient.
